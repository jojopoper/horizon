If your [request method][methods] is not supported by Horizon, Horizon will return a `not_implemented` error.  This is analogous to a [HTTP 501 Error][codes].

If you are encountering this error, Horizon does not have the functionality you are requesting yet.

## Attributes

As with all errors Horizon returns, `not_implemented` follows the [Problem Details for HTTP APIs][guide] draft specification guide and thus has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Type   | Description                                                                                                                     |
| --------- | ----   | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type      | URL    | The identifier for the error.  This is a URL that can be visited in the browser.                                                |
| Title     | String | A short title describing the error.                                                                                             |
| Status    | Number | An HTTP status code that maps to the error.                                                                                     |
| Detail    | String | A more detailed description of the error.                                                                                       |
| Instance  | String | A token that uniquely identifies this request. Allows server administrators to correlate a client report with server log files. |
