id: transactions_create
title: Post Transaction
category: Endpoints
---

Posts a new [transaction](./resources/transaction.md) to the Stellar Network.  Note that creating a valid
transactions and signing it properly is the responsibility of your
client library.

Also note, this endpoint is presently a very thin wrapper around the raw
transaction submission endpoint in stellar-core.  This endpoint will probably
change quite soon to reflect more of the design choices made by the rest of
horizon

## Request

```
POST /transactions
```

## Response

This endpoint returns a resource that represents the result of initial
submission of the provided transaction to stellar-core.

| `result`         |                                                                                                                                             |

| already_finished | The hash for this transaction hash is either in the history database or is in the stellar-core database.                 |
| received         | The transaction was submitted and received by stellar core, and will be included in consideration for a validated [ledger](./resources/ledger.md)|
| failed           | The submission to stellar core failed, and was not received by the network.  Refer to the `submission_result` for details.                  |
| connection_failed| Horizon could not connect to stellar core.                                                                                                  |
