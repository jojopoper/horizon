// Package build provides a builder system for constructing various xdr
// structures used by the stellar network.
//
// At the core of this package is the *Builder and *Mutator types.  A Builder
// object (ex. PaymentBuilder, TransactionBuilder) contain an underlying xdr
// struct that is being iteratively built by having zero or more Mutator structs
// applied to it. See ExampleTransactionBuilder in main_test.go for an example.
